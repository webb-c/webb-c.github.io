## About Me

I am a _research assistant at QIT Lab in KAIST_.  
I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Konkuk University. My research interests focus on theoretical computer science: quantum computing algorithms and complexity theory.

Here is my [CV](http://webb-c.github.io/files/CV.pdf) (Last update: January 2025).
